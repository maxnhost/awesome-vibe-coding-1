The definitive handbook for the next era of software development. Vibe coding simplifies development through AI agents, enabling builders to ship highly complex products rapidly.

The term was [coined by Andrej Karpathy](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383) in February 2025:

> *"There's a new kind of coding I call 'vibe coding', where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists."*

**If you find this useful, please star this repo - it helps others discover it!**

> **Note from the maintainer:** I built this handbook because I was drowning in AI coding tool launches and couldn't find a single place that had everything organized with honest, actionable advice. Whether you're a senior dev evaluating agents or a complete beginner who just heard about "vibe coding" - this is the resource I wish existed when I started. I personally test and verify tools before adding them. If something is missing or outdated, [open an issue](https://github.com/bluegalaxy111/awesome-vibe-coding/issues) or submit a PR.

## 🧭 What Should I Use? (The Complete 2026 Decision Guide)

The AI coding landscape shifted radically in early 2026 (the "Agentic Engineering" era). It's no longer about fancy autocomplete; it's about composing stacks of autonomous software agents. 

Don't just pick one tool. **Pick your workflow.**

### 🟢 Level 1: "I Have Zero Coding Experience"
*You want to describe an app in plain English and get a working product—without ever touching a terminal.*

- 🎯 **For Full-Stack Web Apps:** 👉 Use **[Lovable](https://lovable.dev)**
  - **Why it wins:** Lovable auto-generates your Next.js frontend, connects it to a real Supabase backend PostgreSQL database, and handles one-click deployments to platforms like Vercel.
  - **The "Vibe" Setup:** Create an account, connect GitHub, type: "Build a habit tracker with user auth."
  - **Limitations:** Struggles with complex, non-standard backend logic (e.g., custom webhooks or heavy cron jobs).
  - **Cost Thresholds:** Free to start, but you hit message limits quickly. Pro is $20/mo.

- 🎨 **For Landing Pages & UI Blocks:** 👉 Use **[v0](https://v0.dev)** or **[bolt.new](https://bolt.new)**
  - **Why it wins:** v0 is unmatched for generating pixel-perfect React + Tailwind designs. Bolt.new goes further by running a full Node.js environment in your browser via WebContainers.
  - **Quick Start:** Go to v0.dev. Prompt: "A dark-mode pricing table with glassmorphism."

---

### 🟡 Level 2: "I Want An AI-Native IDE"
*You are a developer who wants visual feedback, a rich ecosystem, and AI deeply integrated into every keystroke.*

- 👑 **The Industry Standard:** 👉 Use **[Cursor](https://cursor.sh)**
  - **Why it wins:** Cursor's "Composer" feature orchestrates parallel AI agents to handle massive multi-file refactors. It sits on top of VS Code, so all your extensions work flawlessly. 
  - **Setup:** Download app → Log in → (Optional) Add your own Anthropic API key to bypass Pro limits.
  - **Pro Tip (Composability):** Start your app in Lovable, push it to GitHub, then clone and open it in Cursor for advanced architectural changes.
  - **Cost Thresholds:** Free tier is very restrictive (slow requests). Pro ($20/mo) is essential for daily drivers.

- ⚡ **The Context-Aware Alternative:** 👉 Use **[Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf)**
  - **Why it wins:** "Cascade" offers deeper, more persistent codebase awareness out of the box without needing extensive `.cursorrules` configurations. Features a generous free tier.

---

### 🔴 Level 3: "I'm a Power User. Give me Terminal Agents."
*You want maximum control, privacy, and the ability to pipe different AI models (like Claude, Gemini, or Local Models) into your workflow.*

- 🧠 **For Maximum Reasoning Power (API/CLI):** 👉 Use **[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)** or **[OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/index/openai-codex/)**
  - **Why Claude wins:** Anthropic's terminal agent natively harnesses Claude's 1M+ token context window. Best-in-class for deeply complex debugging.
  - **Why Codex wins:** The pioneer in generative coding models, heavily updated for 2026. OpenAI's direct Codex CLI integrations offer unmatched latency and deep logical puzzle-solving via o1/Codex reasoning architectures.
  - **Performance Context:** As of April 2026, Claude Opus variants and OpenAI Codex (o1-tier) paired with agentic scaffolding dominate the SWE-bench Verified leaderboard (consistently hitting between 75% and 82%).
  - **Quick Start:** `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` → `claude`
  - **Cost Thresholds:** Pay-per-token API pricing. **Warning:** Extensive context use can rack up a $10 bill in a few hours if you aren't careful.

- 🔧 **For TUI Workflows & Open Source:** 👉 Use **[OpenCode](https://opencode.ai)** or **[Aider](https://aider.chat)**
  - **Why OpenCode:** Exploded in popularity in 2026. A powerful Terminal UI (TUI) that supports 75+ LLMs natively (use whatever API key you want). 
  - **Why Aider:** The veteran open-source tool with the most battle-tested, git-aware, multi-file editing capabilities. 
  - **Quick Start (Aider):** `pip install aider-chat` → `aider --model claude-3-5-sonnet`

---

### 🟣 Level 4: "I Want an Autonomous AI Software Engineer"
*You want to assign a Jira ticket to an AI and go get coffee. Benchmark: Handling end-to-end multi-file implementations autonomously.*

- 🤖 **For Enterprise-Grade Autonomy:** 👉 Use **[Devin](https://devin.ai)**
  - **Why it wins:** The first fully sandboxed autonomous SWE. Incredible capabilities for handling full DevOps pipelines and deployments independently.
  - **Cost:** Enterprise pricing.

- ✨ **For Advanced Concurrent Agentic Power:** 👉 Use **[Google Antigravity](https://deepmind.google/technologies/antigravity)**
  - **Why it wins:** Designed by Google DeepMind, Antigravity introduces revolutionary "Planning Mode" paradigms combined with extreme parallel tool execution. It acts less like a simple code editor and more like a Chief Technology Officer managing a local multi-agent system.
  - **Performance Benchmark:** Antigravity excels in navigating massive monorepos by dynamically creating multi-step implementation plans and requesting human architectural feedback *before* mutating code.

- 🔓 **The Open Source Champion:** 👉 Use **[OpenHands](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands)**
  - **Why it wins:** The premier free, self-hosted alternative to Devin. Run it locally via Docker, hook it up to Claude's API, and let it resolve your GitHub PRs autonomously. 
  - **Performance Benchmark:** OpenHands + Claude scores incredibly high because the sophisticated agentic scaffolding allows the LLM to run bash commands and test its own code before submitting.
  - **Quick Start (Docker required):** 
    ```bash
    docker run -it --pull=always \
      -e WORKSPACE_BASE=$(pwd)/workspace \
      -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
      -p 3000:3000 docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/openhands:0.8
    ```

## Best Practices & Workflows

Proven strategies for effective vibe coding, avoiding common traps.

### The "Think First, Code Second" Workflow

1. **Define requirements** in a document before starting any AI session
2. **Create an architecture plan** (AI can help with this too)
3. **Break work into small tasks** - one feature or component at a time
4. **Use AI to implement** each small task
5. **Test and verify** after each task (don't let AI changes pile up)
6. **Commit frequently** to git - create checkpoints you can revert to

### Golden Rules

-  **Use rules/config files** (`.cursorrules`, `CLAUDE.md`) to give AI your project's conventions
-  **Give AI maximum context** - paste relevant files, types, error logs
-  **Be specific** in prompts - "Add a login form with email/password using React Hook Form and Zod validation" beats "Add login"
-  **Review every change** - Treat AI output like an unreviewed pull request
-  **Use version control** - Git commit before asking AI to make changes, so you can revert
-  **Decompose complex tasks** - Break big features into 3-5 smaller prompts
-  **Don't blindly accept** code you don't understand for production
-  **Don't give vague instructions** - Ambiguity leads to hallucination
-  **Don't skip testing** - AI-generated code needs testing like any other code
-  **Don't use AI for security-critical code** without expert review

### The Two-AI Approach (Advanced)

Many experienced vibe coders use **two tools** together:
1. **Cursor** for fast, iterative UI/UX work and inline editing
2. **Claude Code** for deep architectural reasoning, complex refactors, and comprehensive code reviews

This combination leverages each tool's strengths for maximum productivity.

- Experienced developers report 3-10x productivity increases on routine tasks

### Concerns

- **Maintainability** - Code you don't understand is code you can't debug when it breaks at 2 AM
- **Security** - AI-generated code may contain vulnerabilities that a non-coder can't identify
- **Over-reliance** - Teams that skip understanding fundamentals face scaling challenges
- **Hallucination** - AI can confidently write plausible-looking code that is subtly wrong
- **Technical Debt** - Fast iteration without understanding creates massive debt later
- **Job Market Disruption** - What happens to junior developer roles if AI handles entry-level tasks?
